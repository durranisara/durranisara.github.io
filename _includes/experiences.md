## Research Experience

**Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Research Lab, Islamabad, Pakistan**  
**Research Assistant** | Jun 2020 – Jun 2021  
- Designed multimodal deep learning frameworks integrating speech, text, and prosodic features for Urdu speech emotion recognition.  
- Applied transfer learning using pretrained models (Wav2Vec, ResNet, transformers) to address low-resource language challenges through systematic rule extraction and pattern generalization.  
- Collaborated with Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. (PTCL) on context-aware conversational agents, developing modules for voice activity detection, speaker identification, and emotion recognition.  
- Implemented state-of-the-art NLP models for intent recognition and sentiment analysis in multilingual contexts.  
- Investigated hybrid approaches combining neural networks with rule-based systems to enhance interpretability and robustness of speech processing models.  
- Formalized problem specifications and designed algorithmic solutions requiring rigorous logical reasoning and optimization.  
- Created and maintained large-scale annotated datasets for Urdu speech and text processing.  
- Published two conference papers on multimodal speech emotion recognition and conversational AI systems.

**Al-Khawarizmi Institute of Computer Science (KICS), University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, Pakistan**  
**Research Intern** | Jul 2018 – Aug 2018  
- Worked as a research intern at KICS, contributing to applied research activities in computer science and artificial intelligence.  
- Assisted in problem-solving and research tasks related to data analysis and algorithm development under faculty supervision.  
- Demonstrated strong professional conduct, teamwork, and analytical thinking while working in a research-oriented environment.  
- Gained early research exposure that strengthened foundations in AI, machine learning, and academic research practices.
