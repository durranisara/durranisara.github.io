## Research Experience

**[Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Research Lab, Islamabad, Pakistan](https://isb.nu.edu.pk/aim/students.html)**  
**Research Assistant** | Jun 2020 – Jun 2021  
- Designed multimodal deep learning frameworks integrating speech, text, and prosodic features for Urdu speech emotion recognition.  
- Applied transfer learning using pretrained models (Wav2Vec, ResNet, transformers) to address low-resource language challenges through systematic rule extraction and pattern generalization.  
- Collaborated with Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. (PTCL) on context-aware conversational agents, developing modules for voice activity detection, speaker identification, and emotion recognition.  
- Implemented state-of-the-art NLP models for intent recognition and sentiment analysis in multilingual contexts.  
- Investigated hybrid approaches combining neural networks with rule-based systems to enhance the interpretability and robustness of speech processing models.  
- Formalized problem specifications and designed algorithmic solutions requiring rigorous logical reasoning and optimization.  
- Created and maintained large-scale annotated datasets for Urdu speech and text processing.  
- Published two conference papers on multimodal speech emotion recognition and conversational AI systems.

**[Al-Khawarizmi Institute of Computer Science (KICS), University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, Pakistan](https://kics.edu.pk/web/)**  
**Research Intern** | Jul 2018 – Aug 2018  
- Worked as a Research Assistant on the project titled “Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Text Summarization Using Linguistic Feature Space.”
- Designed and implemented a deep learning–based abstractive text summarization system using neural attention mechanisms and linguistic features.
- Conducted experiments and evaluations to assess summarization quality, achieving competitive performance through a hybrid modelling approach.
