## Research Experience

**Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Research Lab, Islamabad, Pakistan**  
**Research Assistant** | Jun 2020 – Jun 2021  
- Designed multimodal deep learning frameworks integrating speech, text, and prosodic features for Urdu speech emotion recognition.  
- Applied transfer learning using pretrained models (Wav2Vec, ResNet, transformers) to address low-resource language challenges through systematic rule extraction and pattern generalization.  
- Collaborated with Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd. (PTCL) on context-aware conversational agents, developing modules for voice activity detection, speaker identification, and emotion recognition.  
- Implemented state-of-the-art NLP models for intent recognition and sentiment analysis in multilingual contexts.  
- Investigated hybrid approaches combining neural networks with rule-based systems to enhance interpretability and robustness of speech processing models.  
- Formalized problem specifications and designed algorithmic solutions requiring rigorous logical reasoning and optimization.  
- Created and maintained large-scale annotated datasets for Urdu speech and text processing.  
- Published two conference papers on multimodal speech emotion recognition and conversational AI systems.
