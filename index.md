## About Me

Hi, my name is Sara Durrani, an AI researcher with a strong focus on large language models, natural language processing, and multimodal learning. My work centers on building robust and scalable AI systems that perform effectively across languages, domains, and low-resource settings. I am particularly interested in addressing challenges such as data scarcity, class imbalance, and cross-lingual transfer, with real-world applications in areas including social media analysis, healthcare, and public safety.

I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science from the [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST-NUCES)](https://www.nu.edu.pk/), Pakistan, ranked #1 nationally for Computer Science. My research focused on speech affect and emotion recognition in low-resource languages, with a strong emphasis on Urdu. During my thesis, I worked on transfer learning, deep neural networks, and multimodal representations, which later expanded into research on cross-lingual sentiment analysis, threat detection, and multimodal fake-news detection using transformer-based and LLM-driven models. I have over five years of teaching experience as a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, having taught at [Bahria University](https://bahria.edu.pk/) and [Capital University of Science and Technology](https://cust.edu.pk/).

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** Vision–language representation learning, CLIP-based models, multimodal fake news detection, and zero-shot learning.
- **NLP:** Cross-lingual and low-resource language processing, sentiment and threat detection, domain adaptation and imbalanced learning, Transformer-based large language models, domain-adaptive fine-tuning, robustness, calibration, and responsible deployment.
